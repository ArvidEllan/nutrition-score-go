## Directory Purpose

- **internal/**: Private application packages (not importable by other projects)
  - **core/**: Nutritional scoring engine and validation logic
  - **storage/**: JSON file storage and data management
  - **database/**: Embedded food database and search functionality
  - **cli/**: Menu system and user interaction components

- **pkg/**: Public packages that could be imported by other projects
  - **models/**: Common data structures and types

- **data/**: Runtime data storage
  - **exports/**: Generated export files (JSON, CSV)

## Implementation Progress

✅ **Task 1 Complete**: Fixed existing code issues and established project structure
- Fixed syntax errors in main.go and nutritionalscore.go
- Standardized function names (GetNutritionalScore, ScoreType)
- Removed duplicate code and main functions
- Created modular directory structure
- Verified application compiles and runs correctly

## Next Steps

The foundation is now ready for implementing the enhanced features:
- Enhanced data models (Task 2)
- Accurate nutritional scoring engine (Task 3)
- Food database service (Task 4)
- Storage and persistence layer (Task 5)
- Enhanced CLI interface (Task 6)
- Food comparison functionality (Task 7)
- Application integration (Task 8)
- Final polish and documentation (Task 9)
