# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing nutritional score calculator by adding a comprehensive user interface, food database integration, improved scoring algorithms, data persistence, and additional functionality to make it a complete nutritional analysis tool. The enhancement will transform the basic CLI tool into a robust application that can store food data, provide detailed nutritional analysis, and offer user-friendly interfaces for both CLI and potential web access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input food nutritional data through an improved interface, so that I can easily calculate nutritional scores without dealing with complex command-line prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the application THEN the system SHALL present a clear menu with options to calculate scores, view saved foods, or manage the food database
2. WHEN a user selects to calculate a nutritional score THEN the system SHALL provide guided input with validation for each nutritional component
3. WHEN a user enters invalid nutritional data THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and prompt for correct input
4. WHEN a user completes nutritional data entry THEN the system SHALL display the calculated score with detailed breakdown of positive and negative points

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and retrieve food items with their nutritional data, so that I can quickly calculate scores for foods I commonly consume without re-entering data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calculates a nutritional score THEN the system SHALL offer to save the food item with a custom name
2. WHEN a user chooses to save a food item THEN the system SHALL store the food name and all nutritional data persistently
3. WHEN a user wants to calculate a score for a saved food THEN the system SHALL display a list of saved foods to choose from
4. WHEN a user selects a saved food THEN the system SHALL automatically load the nutritional data and calculate the score
5. WHEN a user wants to manage saved foods THEN the system SHALL provide options to view, edit, or delete saved food items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a database of common foods with pre-populated nutritional data, so that I can quickly get nutritional scores without manually entering data for well-known foods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a food item THEN the system SHALL provide a list of matching foods from the built-in database
2. WHEN a user selects a food from the database THEN the system SHALL automatically populate all nutritional fields with accurate data
3. WHEN the system loads food database data THEN it SHALL use standardized nutritional values per 100g serving
4. WHEN a user wants to modify database food data THEN the system SHALL allow temporary modifications without affecting the original database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the nutritional scoring algorithm to be accurate and configurable, so that the system can provide reliable nutritional assessments based on established standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calculates nutritional scores THEN it SHALL use the official Nutri-Score algorithm with correct point thresholds
2. WHEN calculating scores for different food types THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate scoring rules for Food, Beverage, Water, and Cheese categories
3. WHEN the system processes nutritional data THEN it SHALL validate that all values are within realistic ranges
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show both the numerical score and the corresponding letter grade (A-E)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare multiple foods side by side, so that I can make informed decisions about which foods are more nutritionally beneficial.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to compare foods THEN the system SHALL allow selection of multiple food items for comparison
2. WHEN comparing foods THEN the system SHALL display nutritional scores, letter grades, and detailed breakdowns in a clear format
3. WHEN viewing comparisons THEN the system SHALL highlight which food has the better nutritional profile
4. WHEN comparing foods of different types THEN the system SHALL indicate if direct comparison is appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my nutritional analysis data, so that I can share results or import them into other health tracking applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes nutritional analysis THEN the system SHALL offer export options in JSON and CSV formats
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all nutritional values, calculated scores, and timestamps
3. WHEN a user wants to export multiple food analyses THEN the system SHALL support batch export functionality
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL ensure the exported format is compatible with common spreadsheet applications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my nutritional analysis history, so that I can monitor my food choices over time and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calculates nutritional scores THEN the system SHALL automatically save the analysis with timestamp
2. WHEN a user views history THEN the system SHALL display chronological list of all previous analyses
3. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date range, food type, or score range
4. WHEN analyzing history THEN the system SHALL show basic statistics like average scores and most frequently analyzed foods
